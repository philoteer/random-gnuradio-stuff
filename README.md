# random-gnuradio-stuff
Random GNURadio stuff. Bunch of unfinished / dirty code fragments.

Have nothing really useful here (just for personal research), but take 'em if you want - under GPL v3.0 license (one that GNURadio project uses - since I may copy & paste source codes from the main GNU Radio repository).
